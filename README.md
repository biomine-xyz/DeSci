# Specifications
- Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data recorded in vendor-specific formats
- For exchangeability most often converted to XML schema-based format https://www.psidev.info/mzML
- Could also be represented as rows and columns in a relational database
- Metadata concerning individuals could be part of database
