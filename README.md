- incentivize people to share metabolomics & exposomics data to
  - enable population-scale studies 
  - enable post theory science
  - enable personalized health
- create a data marketplace to 
  - enable DeSci

# Specifications
- Metabolomics (mass spectrometry) data can be represented as rows and columns in a relational database
  - List papers (mzDB, mzMLb, stack something) ?
  - upload data
- Metadata part of databse (recorded personal information and surveys)
  - like 23 and me give examples

## Storage
- Store database rows as encrypted distributed shards 

## Governance
- Data is recorded (anonymized) by lab 
- Only user can assemble shards back into a full dataset (via private key?)
- External users can get one-time, read-only access to the data if the user so chooses (via public key?)
  - only metadata they bargained for 
- Data sharing is easy and transparent

## Features
- Marketplace for data
- DAO votes for reasearch targets for biomine core
- Get token for sharing data, know whom you share it with

# Tasks
- Learn about metabolomics data
- Create a concept for blockchain
